			<h3>1: Would you rather eat dining hall food or cook for yourself off-campus? </h3>

						<b class="article"><p>Dining hall food<br></b>
						<i>by Lucas Matney</i></p>
						<p>Corn pops, Milanos, and Peach Snapple. If I were to make all of my meals that is what I would eat everyday for every meal. Along with a decent percentage of this school, I am currently dropping $5,670 on a dining hall plan that always leaves me asking for more. At my dining hall, Allison, the pizza is pretty greasy, the meat is often overcooked and having grilled chicken means waiting 15 minutes. That said, my dining hall is super friendly and crazy convenient. Without it I’m unsure if I could stably feed myself.</p>
						<p>Stepping into the Allison dining hall to hear Ellery’s enthusiastic rallying cry of “Happy Friday!” is often enough to make me forget the midterm I just bombed and the questionable selections served in the vegan section. A great thing about the dining hall system is getting to interact with the staff, since there are a lot of friendly people who always seem happy to be working there. Even when the food has it’s low points, knowing that the guy at the wrap station knows what I want when I ask for “the usual” is pretty sweet.</p>
						<p>The convenience of having a dining hall so close is pretty much insane. During most of the hours that I’m hungry I can literally walk down two flights of stairs and be in an area where there is endless food. It’s always hot, always stocked and even when the food is sketchy there’s always something good at the Kosher station. Allison is open on the weekends this year which is an added bonus if you are lucky enough to live there. Sorry Hinman.</p>
						<p>One thing that does irk me about the dining hall plans is that they really seem too overpriced for what you’re usually getting. The fact that I could get 14 meals a week from Chipotle for half of what I’m paying per week for meals from nuCuisine just kind of sucks. But the convenience and variety that you can get from nuCuisine is unmatched. I’ve got some critiques for the meal plans, but I would much rather pay for nuCusine than use up the extra time and effort to make meals on my own everyday.</p>

						<b class="article"><p>Cooking for myself off-campus<br></b>
						<i>by AJ Rim</i></p>
						<p>I don’t like cooking. For my first couple of weeks off-campus, all I made was pasta with marinara sauce. One time I was feeling creative, so I got mini bow tie pasta, put fettuccini sauce on it and stirred in vegan sausage (I’m not vegan). It was a sad attempt further bungled with every added ingredient. It made me feel unhappier with every bite.</p>
						<p>The moral of the story is that I neither enjoy cooking nor am I good at it. But I’d still prefer it over four years of dining hall food. Don’t get me wrong - I still think the dining halls are the bomb. The staff is friendly and fun to talk with, I can tell the chefs work hard at making the food, the dining halls are very clean, and provide a location for lots of serendipitous bump-ins with friends. But I’d give it all up for the flexibility and the frugality of doing it myself. Let's start with the cheaper prices.</p>
						<p>With my basic arithmetic, I’ve figured out that it costs a bit over $15 per meal to be on the basic block plan. That’s right, $15. For that amount, I could go to Chipotle, Joy Yees, Cheesie’s and basically most restaurants in the Evanston area for a good meal. But even if I had to make my own food, I could even go to Whole Foods, buy myself a load of fresh ingredients, and make the best artisanal pasta ever.</p>
						<p>And no one is around to judge me for what I eat, when I eat, and how I eat. All I’ve got is a Kraft slices and Franzia? Sounds like a delicious midnight cheese and wine tasting. Dining hall has reduced lunch selection after 1:30 p.m? No more settling for cheeseburgers and leftover pizza at Plex for the third time this week because my class gets out at 1:50p.m. And I feel like eating rice with a fork? <a href="http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/story/culture-shock-why-dont-americans-eat-rice-with-/" target="_blank">No one’s even there to write an article about it.</a></p>

			<h3>2: Would you rather have a few close friends or several acquaintances?</h3>
			<div>

						<b class="article"><p>Several acquaintances<br></b>
						<i>by Bret Greenacre</i></p>
						<p>It’s one of the greatest days of your life: college graduation. As you turn your tassel and throw your cap into the air, you reflect on the great times you’ve had at NU with your closest friends. While those experiences shared in Evanston may have come to an end, they’re sure to continue, right?</p>
						<p>Not exactly. Leaving college with only your best buds isn’t the best idea; rather, it’s much better to know a bunch of people coming out of college. If you don’t believe me, let’s look at what’ll happen if you have a couple of close friends.</p>
						<p>You and your friends say your last goodbyes, and go your separate ways. You’ve got a great job lined up in Silicon Valley, and you’re excited to start a new chapter in your life. However, your friends aren’t there with you. You still Skype and Snapchat them, but it just isn’t the same. You don’t get to do the same things you used to do together – there aren’t any parties that your group can go to, and you find yourself watching The Fault In Our Stars by yourself at the movies. As time goes by, you slowly but surely find yourself separating from your closest friends. You still have a great relationship with them, but it’s all for naught – what is there to do in Silicon Valley? In the end, you lack the one thing you wanted all along: a life–long best friend.</p>
						<p>Now, imagine that there were a bunch of people you knew from NU. They may not be close friends, but they’re good acquaintances that you can get along with. Odds are that a couple of these friends are working in Silicon Valley, too. Being with people you know makes the transition to post–college life so much easier.</p>
						<p>Also, not being attached to a few friends before you move out to start your career allows you to make new friends in Silicon Valley much more easily. Since you don’t already have any close friends, you’re open to making new friends; you go see Transformers 4 with your coworkers, and check out the Cali dating scene with your friends from NU. While you don’t have one or two close friends at the moment, you are bound to make them, and you’re already having a lot of fun – even without them!</p>
						<p>At the end of the day, it’s extremely difficult to keep up a strong relationship with people you’re away from. While one may wish to retain a close friendship – after all, having someone you can trust helps you get through rough patches in your life – the constraints of human life make this depressingly unfeasible. That’s why it’s better to have many acquaintances coming out of college; they will be there to help you adjust to your new life, and there’s no way you won’t have new best friends soon after! Don’t worry – look at all of the friends you’ve made in your first months as a Wildcat!</p>

						<b class="article"><p>Keep your "friends" close and your real friends closer<br></b>
						<i>by Orko Manna</i></p>
						<p>I love being surrounded by people. As creepy and as needy as that sounds, it’s true. I find the most happiness when I’m doing something with a group of friends, whether it’s playing a game, watching a movie or going to Cheesie’s at 2 a.m. (more often the latter). I mean, I like being social. I love meeting new people, hanging out with them and becoming friends with them.</p>
						<p>But sometimes I feel like the people we call our “friends” are more like acquaintances, and sometimes not even that. In a world where egos are boosted by large numbers of Facebook friends and Twitter followers (do people even KNOW 2,500 people?!?), having real friends can sometimes be put on the backburner. But this shouldn’t be the case.</p>
						<p>I’d rather have a few close friends than a hoard of pseudo-friends.</p>
						<p>Real friends are there for you when times are tough. Northwestern is the type of school where one week you could feel like Beyoncé aka a blissful immortal, and the next you could feel like you have <a href="http://imgur.com/zDUS6zP" target="_blank">no control over your life</a>. Spring quarter last year was a bit of struggle for me, and there was one week that was by far the most struggle-inducing. I overburdened myself with meetings, had rehearsals for a show I was in and had three papers to write. Needless to say, it was a dark time – and also literally dark, because there is no sunlight at 3 a.m. I had plenty of “friends” who said they felt bad for me, and then proceeded to frolic away from me. THANKS GUYS. But one real friend took the time – and money – to get me an iced tea-lemonade from Starbucks the morning after my papers were due. Even though it was a small act of kindness, it really meant a lot to me.</p>
						<p>But the thing I enjoy the most about real friends is the deep conversation. I don’t mean to say strangers at NU don’t have deep conversations – I mean, we’re at Northwestern. But in casual conversation, real friends go beyond the typical, surface-level “how are you?”-type questions. They talk about how they feel and what’s going on in their lives beyond schoolwork. I was recently chilling with a friend and we started talking about all the work we had – a typical thing for an NU student to do. But then, we started talking about philosophy and what we thought determined good and evil. We talked broadly, and then brought it back to personal experiences. My mind was blown by the conversation itself and probably more so by the fact that we had the conversation in the first place. I would rather talk to one real friend about the meaning of life (woah that got deep) than say “hi-bye” to half of campus.</p>
						<p>So, just like any other person at Northwestern – and anywhere for that matter – I’m just trying to find that balance between quality and quantity in my life. And when it comes to friends, I’d choose quality over quantity any day.</p>

			<h3>3: Would you rather be really involved in your classes or extracurriculars?</h3>

						<b class="article"><p>Academics<br></b>
						<i>by Kelly Gonsalves</i></p>
						<p>I have become a master of time capitalization. I plan every minute of every hour of every day of every week. Between the three campus publications and two outside publications for which I write, the weekly team brainstorms for A&O and the Global Engagement Summit’s marketing committees, the Sunday school class I teach at the Sheil Catholic Center and the five NU courses I am taking this quarter, I need to.</p>
						<p>I have mastered the art of scoring well on exams with the least amount of studying necessary (and while still maintaining my academic integrity, mind you). I can actively participate in discussion sections without ever having opened a course packet. I run from meeting to meeting to meeting to squeezing in an hour to write a five-page religion paper to meeting again. I maximize time in a way that astounds even myself.</p>
						<p>A few days ago, after a class period of group presentations, my marketing professor got up and summarized what we had been learning through this project for the last few weeks. We had apparently learned about regressions and how to apply our analyses to real-world business scenarios, he explained. We had repeated equations over and over and over in order to reach our results. It had been a long, laborious process, but we should feel proud of how much knowledge we’ve acquired over such a short period of time. But as he continued to praise us, all I could think was, did I actually do any of that?</p>
						<p>I thought hard about the presentation I had just given. I had run a single regression equation. I had recited lines I had memorized about how to interpret charts from a stats program. I had spent an hour before class putting together the slideshow. Somewhere between the eight organizations I actively participate in, between the deadlines on deadlines on deadlines, these first six weeks of class have been buried and blurred.</p>
						<p>Don’t get me wrong – I aced the assignment. But did I actually learn anything?</p>
						<p>The truth is, I did exactly what they told me not to do. I overcommitted.</p>
						<p>As a freshman, I dipped my toes in an array of different organizations, as freshman are expected to do while shopping for clubs. However, I never took my feet out. And here I am, halfway through the quarter with a million and a half writing clips under my belt and a resumé thick with experience just like I had hoped for, without a minute recollection of the last time I opened up my marketing textbook.</p>
						<p>I probably attend thrice as many campus and city events as the average college student, and I know the artists being brought for Blowout and Ball weeks before anyone else. More than that, I feel like a real journalist. I am constantly on deadline, running about the city every day to cover the latest town-gown gathering or collect man-on-the-street interviews on college students' latest fashion fears. I am growing, and so is my resumé. Have my grades suffered? No. But my wealth of knowledge has.</p>
						<p>I’ll never get back those eleven chapters of my marketing textbook that I never read, nor all those group projects I could have put more into, understood more fully, been more proud of. I’ll never get to repeat those discussions on spirituality and Catholic modernity in my religion class that I couldn’t participate in because I hadn’t done the readings, nor will I get to hear my urban politics professor explain again why city governments are not equipped to handle the increased concentration of poverty growing in their alleyways. That is all knowledge that was presented to me and that I have consciously rejected. I’ve slipped through over half a quarter of classes without having learned anything. And that’s sad.</p>
						<p>Northwestern students love to overcommit ourselves. We have been cast into such a highly competitive environment that we feel compelled to join extracurricular activities to show our worth, gather experience and meet new people. But the truth is, everything you could possibly gain from a college organization can also be gained out in the real world. I will leave college and be immersed in the journalistic endeavors I just spent four years doing through the campus paper, magazine and fashion blog.</p>
						<p>But what I will never do again after college is over is study. I will not read a textbook without prompting as an adult. I will again never be surrounded by a roomful of intellectual, motivated young adults tasked with discussing real sociological issues. I will never again have the privilege of hearing some of the brightest academic minds of the nation lecturing me on their latest research paper. I have turned down knowledge that I will never have a chance to acquire again. And I regret it.</p>

						<b class="article"><p>Extracurriculars<br></b>
						<i>by Sam Freedman</i></p>
						<p>I’ve wanted to read Moby-Dick ever since I saw the film at age nine – so much so that by the time I graduated high school, setting aside the time to read the gargantuan novel had become a bona fide bucket list staple. It sat right between filmmaking and falling in love at the top of my college agenda.</p>
						<p>Now it’s November of my sophomore year, I’m enrolled in American Literary Traditions, and the last three weeks of the quarter are devoted to, of all novels, Moby-Dick. Our class is three hundred pages in; I’ve read a couple chapters. The rest has been skimmed and SparkNoted, because between all my meetings, projects and emails, I’ve hardly got time for a three o’clock nap. A whaling epic requires an attention span; that’s something I don’t have right now.</p>
						<p>For the first time in my life, 24-hour days have ceased to be sufficient. My screenwriting professor assigns glorious prompts each week, but I find myself finishing them at four in the morning. I came to college to take classes and obtain a degree, and I’ll do it – my grades are right where I need them to be. Still, my eyelids keep drooping during American Lit lectures, and it throws me into conflict: I wanna read about a giant, philosophically-charged whale, but would I drop everything else to make it happen?</p>
						<p>The answer is unequivocally no.</p>
						<p>I can’t help but look back at my freshman fall quarter. Northwestern was new, and my extracurricular life hadn’t been so low-key since middle school. I loved my classes. I was enrolled in a humanities scholars program that ate my time but opened my eyes; I left every Intro to Psychology lecture feeling savvy and strangely upbeat. Paradoxically, though, I felt like an amoeba. When I wasn’t in a desk-chair or a dining hall, I’d start to wonder what the hell I was doing. It didn’t seem like I belonged in any particular place; I felt aimless.</p>
						<p>Then winter quarter arrived, and my newfound campus activities gave me purpose. They kept me on my toes and made college feel meaningful. Granted, after a while, the commitments began to spiral out of control. Positions and possibilities beckoned, and I found the siren song of campus involvement impossible to resist. I would leave class each day feeling guilty – struck with the sinking feeling that I wasn’t living up to my potential. It was a stunning reversal from the fall, and it made me feel rotten.</p>
						<p>Now time has passed, and my perspective’s evolving. I’ve begun to feel the winds – of cold air, unfortunately, but of change as well. I’m done feeling guilty about my level of involvement in the Northwestern community. Does it injure my academic resolve? Yes. Does that mean I’m doing it all wrong? Not in the slightest.</p>
						<p>I’ve been a student my whole life, and in spite of my shifting priorities, I’m still learning. My involvements haven’t impeded my ability to absorb information. Though they’re an unquestionable distraction from my books, they’ve imbued me with a sense of individuality that I’d never trade for more time to read peer-reviewed articles. My participation in campus life allows me to leave a mark on the school I so love; without it, I’d graduate uncertain as to the impact I’d made. If that thought doesn’t light a fire under a Wildcat’s ass, I don’t know what will.</p>
						<p>I’ll admit that even now, I sometimes regret my lack of time for academics. I haven’t phased them out, but they’re certainly getting the short end of the stick. In the end, however, I’m not going to abandon my commitments, and there are inevitably more coming down the pike. We are Northwestern students, after all – overcommitment’s in our blood. Some choose to trim the fat. I’m more of a do-it-all kind of guy.</p>
						<p>Does this mean I can’t take anything out of my classes in the process? Not remotely. As I learn to pick my involvements more carefully, I might even find a way to suffer through the Chicago winter with genuine academic zeal. It’s all a matter of perspective. I’m sure a better balance exists, and one day, I hope to be able to strike it. In the mean time, however, my commitments remain my priority, and when the lights of Christmas bear us into break, I’ll get around to finishing Moby-Dick.</p>
						<p>Well, maybe. If there’s enough time between naps and slumber.</p>
